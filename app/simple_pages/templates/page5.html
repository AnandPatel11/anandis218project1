        A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. It is a feature available in most modern version control systems. A Git project can have more than one branch. These branches are a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, you spawn a new branch to summarize your changes. So, it is complex to merge the unstable code with the main code base and also facilitates you to clean up your future history before merging with the main branch.

        In Git, the merging is a procedure to connect the forked history. It joins two or more development history together. The git merge command facilitates you to take the data created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. Git merge will associate a series of commits into one unified history. Generally, git merge is used to combine two branches.
        Once Git finds a shared base commit, it will create a new "merge commit." It combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence.

        One way to think about commits is that they are a snapshot of a project during a certain moment in the projectâ€™s history. When a commit is created, it creates a record of how all the files and directories appeared in a project at the time the commit was created.
          This record can then be read in the future to see how a project looked at a point in time and who made what changes to what files in the project. Indeed, commits are an important feature of Git because it allows developers to keep a comprehensive record of how their repository has evolved over time.

          Tags make a point as a specific point in Git history. Tags are used to mark a commit stage as relevant. We can tag a commit for future reference. Primarily, it is used to mark a project's initial point like v1.1.
          Tags are much like branches, and they do not change once initiated. We can have any number of tags on a branch or different branches.

          In Git, the repository is like a data structure used by VCS to store metadata for a set of files and directories. It contains the collection of the files as well as the history of changes made to those files. Repository in Git is considered as your project folder. A repository has all the project-related data. Distinct projects have distinct repositories.
